## History

In April 2017 a group of Manitoban network operators got together and talked about networking openly. This was a beta test for a group that would meet semi-regularly and continue those open discussions, a test which was highly successful. Since this event was a beta test, and network operators also tend to think like programmers, the first meeting was called MBNOG 0.
