Our initial alpha form of the [MBNOG Looking Glass](https://lg.mbnog.net) was announced to the local network operator community via a post on the MBIX-tech mailing list.

This resulted in a couple more peers, and enough interest to continue on with this idea.

If you run a network with full or partial routes (more than default only) MBNOG wants to peer with you. More information is available on the [Looking Glass](/looking-glass) page.
